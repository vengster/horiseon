# Code Refactor Starter Code

Website needs to be refactored for accessibilty. I've cleaned up the semantics of the HTMl so that it is easier to read. I've also cleaned up the code from missing tags and extra tags.
Below is a list of all changes made.




LIST OF CHANGES MADE TO THE CODE
Made notes for myself on HTML file to outline a more semantic strucutre to the code.

Renamed elements in the navigation section to follow semantic HTML. Also renamed the css selectors to the respective elements that were changed in the HTML. 

Renamed "hero" <div> to <section> so that it is more aligned with semantic HTML.

Fixed search engine optimization navigation link by adding corresponding id attribute.

Added alt attribute to all .jpg and .png

Removed closing image tag in cost management div.

Changed title to "Horiseon".
