# Code Refactor Starter Code
Made notes for myself on HTML file to outline a more semantic strucutre to the code.
Renamed elements in the navigation section to follow semantic HTML. Also renamed the css selectors to the respective elements that were changed in the HTML. 
Renamed "hero" <div> to <section> so that it is more aligned with semantic HTML.
